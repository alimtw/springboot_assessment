Submission of Spring boot assessment

●  	What did you like about this project?

This project let you start from the beginning of the FSD where need to create HTML/JS and then Backend Java as well as the API and the MVC configuration. Is a good understanding of the basic flow. It also show that to be a good FSD, you need to be very knowledgeble from different coding language, libraries and APIs. It show how complicated and difficult for developer.

●  	What did you struggle with in this project?
The starting part need to revise on the HTML JS MySQL. Then need to understand the MVC framework with all the libraries and API that had learned to apply. 

The DATE at the backend is difficult. Did research with different suggestion like Plug-In, Dependencis and DateFormatter. However, do not know how to apply on the backend project.

The form fill in where at the input did indicated Required. On VSC, but when at the backend, it does not work when display on localhost. Also, same problem as regards to the web browser cacher where thinking that data is not capture till use the private browser.

●  	What would make your experience with this assessment better?

For sure, this subject need alot of time to learn and practice. It is not so straight forward and alot of reading and understanding of the libraries, method and how it is being applied for the developing of a webapplication. It really need to take years and years of exposure and learning
